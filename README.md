# HWP - Hypirae's Word Processor
HWP is a simple, terminal based, "word processor". It is a work in progress with little more than some drawing functions put together. In the future the idea is to have a simple interface for writing using markdown in the terminal.

- [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/)
